        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Janine Chang and I am currently a third year undergraduate student at UCR majoring in Microbiology. I am currently planning to graduate in 2021. I am also considering a minor in business, however I am not too sure if I will pull through with this idea. I started to build interest for business through an Econ class I took during my second year. I plan to also earn a master's degree later in the future. I am a Korean-American who was raised in America in a family of five. I have traveled around to many different countries with my family when I was a little younger and I wish to travel once again after my studies. I am bilingual knowing both English and Korean. I am thankful that I was given the opportunity to learn both languages. I am also open to learning more languages, but sign language has been a big interest to me for a while. In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends and listen to music. I also like to play different instruments. <br><br>

       I currently work at Starbucks as a part-time worker. I am always interested in trying new things which is why I have decided to experience life as a barista. Working as a part-time worker while being a full-time student was not easy at first, I have been able to learn time management skills through working. I believe I have learned how to multitask and also talk to new people in a comfortable way. There are always ups and downs in the work environment, but for the most part, I enjoy working. One fun fact about me, is that I do not really enjoy drinking coffee, but I work at a coffee shop. I usually enjoy the teas or refreshers at Starbucks. I am glad I decided to work during my college years. <br><br>

      One interest I have always had as a kid was the many different scents that exist in this world. Everything from the clean fresh morning air, candle scents, perfume, and food aromas. Because of this, I built interest in becoming a fragrance chemist one day in the future. This is also the reason why I am trying to major in Microbiology so that I can become a chemist. I feel very lucky to know what I want to do in my life and to have the opportunity to make that come true. Knowing this, I try my best to follow the right path to doing what I love. The reason behind wanting to have a minor in business is because I wish to later open up my own fragrance line. It is a big goal and still many years of hard work, but I believe in myself that I will be able to make my dream come true.
